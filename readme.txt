== Description ==

Allows you to use the power and flexibility of the WordPress Widgets to set up a dynamic area anywhere in your site and manage multiple columns of widgets, dragging and dropping them around

== Installation ==

1. Download the package
2. Upload to the plugins folder
3. activate it

== Usage ==

The basics:

Go to the theme file where you want to put eletro-widgets and add the following code:

<?php if class_exists('EletroWidgets') new EletroWidgets(); ?>

This will create a two column container on your site where you will be able to add the widgets.

The first paramater it takes is the number of columns you want your container to have. So, if you want a 3 columns container, this is what you have to do:

<?php if class_exists('EletroWidgets') new EletroWidgets(3); ?>


== Customizing the appearance of the widgets ==

Eletro Widgets comes with a default css stylesheet that you can customize to fit your theme.

In order to do that, copy the file eletro-widgets.css to your theme's folder and edit it there as you like.


== Advanced - multiple containers on the same page ==

Eletro Widgets allow you to have more than one container of widgets at the same page.

For example, you can have one line with 3 columns of widgets, and another set of 2 columns of widgets underneath.

In order to do that, all you have to do is declare a new instance of EletroWidgets passing the second parameter, wich is the unique ID for this container.

Example:

<?php if class_exists('EletroWidgets') new EletroWidgets(); ?>
<?php if class_exists('EletroWidgets') new EletroWidgets(3, 2); ?>

Note: There MUST be at least one container with the ID 0 (zero). All you have to do is declare at least one EletroWidget leaving the ID parameter empty

After that, make sure you have styles for all the containers in your eletro-widgets.css file. There are examples in this file so you can create as much containers as you need.
